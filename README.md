# odin_etch_a_scetch

In this project my plan to build an Etch a Sketch game, where I need to use my
DOM manipulation skills and I have to learn some new things by using the Google
to build this game.

Base plan to build a 16x16 grid of square divs which will color the divs by
mouse hover effect by an event listener. This will only use black to color the
divs.

If I have more time, I can add a button which will change the fill color on the
RGB range.
